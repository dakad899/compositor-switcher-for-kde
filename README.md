##### What the hell is that thing?
This is a background application that checks KWin's OpenGL / XRender compositor state every X seconds. I made this application for my personel use and than decided to share others.

##### Why should I use?
If you are a gamer. Some of GNU/Linux window managers' compositors causes screen tearing and FPS drop in games. Compositor Switcher for KDE, disable compositor when certain processes activated and re-enable when processes terminated.

##### OK, looks good. How can I use?
Download latest release from "Releases" section. Make executable and run.

##### Give me some process names!
